**Explore the sections using the menu in the sidebar on the left:**

* **Recipe Book:** Browse, search, and view your saved recipes.
* **Add/Edit:** Manually enter new recipes or edit existing ones.
* **Import Recipe:** Add recipes by digitizing them from images/PDFs or importing from URLs.
* **Pantry Management:** Keep track of the ingredients you have available.
* **Ingredient Management:** View and manage the main list of ingredients known to the app.
* **AI Suggestions:** Ask the AI what to cook based on your recipe book and pantry, or have it generate completely new recipes.
* **Advanced Search:** Use the power of Azure AI Search to find recipes in your database.

*(This is the main page. The specific logic for each section is found in the corresponding files in the `pages/` folder)*

# --- Additional Home Page Logic (if needed) ---
# For example, you could show a summary, the latest added recipes, etc.
# But keep this file lean; main logic goes in the other pages.

# --- Example of Session State Initialization (if you need a global state) ---
# if 'app_initialized' not in st.session_state:
#     st.session_state['app_initialized'] = True
#     st.session_state['user_id'] = "default_user" # For now, single user
#     # Initialize other global state variables if necessary
#     print("Session state initialized.")

# Remember: Most of the UI code and logic will go in the files
# inside the 'pages/' folder and in the modules inside 'src/'.
